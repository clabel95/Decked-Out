## Overview
This app allows the user to create save and view different flashcard decks either on the go or at home. The user will create an account or login and then they will be able to view previously created decks and cards, or they will be able to create a whole new deck with as many cards as they want. After the user has created their desired amount of cards they are able to save that deck and view it at any time from their user tab.
